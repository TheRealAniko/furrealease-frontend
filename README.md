# FurRealEase 🐾

**Final Full Stack Project – Web Development Bootcamp**

FurRealEase is a pet health manager app that allows users to track and organize important health data for their pets – including profiles, weight logs, vaccinations, medications, notes, vet visits and custom reminders.

I built this project from scratch as a solo developer – frontend, backend, design, database, authentication and deployment.

> ⚠️ Note: The app is not yet fully responsive. Some features may look best on desktop.

## 🎨 Design & Planning

Before building the app, I created a full layout, style guide and wireframes in Figma to plan structure, flow and consistency.

While not everything made it 1:1 into the final product, it helped me stay focused and intentional in my development process.
